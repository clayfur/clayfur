# 👋 Hi there! I’m @clayfur
- 👀 I’m interested in creating something new from some open source tech here. Look out for new repos as I work on them.
- 🌱 Currently working with JavaScript for a creative coding project.
- 💞️ Up for collaboration any time.
- 🧪 Studying Machine Learning among other interests.
- 👾 I like video games particularly challenging and puzzling ones so some of my projects may be inspired by games.
- 🎨 I also like art and sketching and design work in general so the sketch on the side is part of that interest.
